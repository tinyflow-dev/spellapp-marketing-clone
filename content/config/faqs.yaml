  - question: What is Spell?
    answer: Spell is an AI-powered document platform that lets you create, edit, and collaborate on documents — fast. You can generate drafts in seconds with AI, edit them using natural language prompts, and work with your team in real time. Think of it like Google Docs or Microsoft Word — but with built-in AI that helps you draft, refine, and improve your writing as you go. Unlike other AI tools, Spell is a full-featured doc editor, so everything stays properly formatted and ready to share. The goal is simple - to help you write documents so good they blow away your boss, your team, or anyone else reading them - and to do in *minutes* what would otherwise take days or weeks.
  - question: How is Spell different from Google Docs or Word?
    answer: Unlike Google Docs or Word, Spell is built from the ground up with AI at the center. You can generate drafts, edit using natural language, and collaborate in real time — without jumping between tools or wasting a bunch of time fixing the formatting of the text you copy/pasted into your doc editor. And instead of writing prompts in ChatGPT, copying them over, and going back and forth for every change, you can do the entire workflow directly in Spell—drafting, editing, and polishing in one place, with clean formatting the whole way through.
  - question: How is Spell different from ChatGPT or other AI models?
    answer: Unlike ChatGPT — which gives generic, one-off responses in a chat window — Spell is a real-time collaborative document editor with deeply integrated AI designed to help you create high-quality, polished work. Imagine if Google Docs had ChatGPT built directly into it - that's Spell. We do a lot of work under the hood to produce much better document outputs than ChatGPT or other LLMs, which typically generate generic text because they aren't built specifically for writing docs. Spell is fine-tuned and optimized for long-form doc writing, so you get clearer, more structured, and more professional results. It's also a fully collaborative editor — basically like AI-first Google Docs — so you don't have to copy and paste AI output into another tool. You can generate your first draft directly in Spell, then continue editing manually or using AI, all in one place.
  - question: Is my data private? Do you use my data to train your AI?
    answer: Yes, your documents are private, encrypted, and secure. And no, we do not use your documents to train our AI. You always own your content - We don't sell your data, share it with third parties, or use it for anything other than helping you write great documents. Only the people you explicitly share a document with can access it. Privacy and good data stewardship are core principles at Spell, and your work stays fully in your control.
  - question: What's the difference between Spell and just using ChatGPT with Google Docs?
    answer: With Spell, everything happens in one place — no switching between tabs, no copy-pasting, and no broken formatting. Plus, Spell is purpose-built for documents, so the outputs are higher quality, easier to format, and better suited for real work. Unlike Google Docs and Microsoft Word, which may use your content to train their AI models unless you opt out, Spell never uses your documents for AI training. Your content stays private, never feeds public models, and is never exposed to systems beyond your own use — so your work is safe, secure, and fully under your control.
  - question: What types of documents can I create using Spell?
    answer: Spell can help you create just about any document you need — whether you're writing for work, school, or personal use. From business plans, job descriptions, strategy docs, and financial reports to research papers, lab reports, personal statements, and essays, Spell understands the structure and tone of each format. You can also write memos, marketing briefs, onboarding guides, meeting agendas, customer emails, and even speeches or short stories. Whatever you're working on, Spell helps you go from blank page to polished doc 10x faster.
  - question: Can I edit my document manually, or do I have to use AI?
    answer: Yes, you can edit your documents manually just like a normal doc editor. Spell gives you the best of both worlds — use AI when you want to move faster, or write and revise everything yourself. It's flexible, so you're always in control of how your document comes together.
  - question: What if I don't like the AI's output?
    answer: Spell is built for iteration. You can easily regenerate a section, revise it using a natural language prompt, or make manual edits. You're never stuck with what the AI gives you — you always have full control to tweak and improve your document until it's just right.
  - question: How much does Spell cost?
    answer: Spell has a generous free plan that you can use forever, with limits on the number of AI messages — similar to how the free version of ChatGPT works. If you need more usage, the Pro plan is $20/month and gives you a higher limit of AI messages. For teams, we offer a $40/user/month plan that includes advanced collaboration features, more control over permissions, and everything you need to work together at scale.
  - question: Can I use Spell with my team?
    answer: Yes, Spell is built for teams to get real work done together. It's a collaborative document editor — like Google Docs—but with an AI writing copilot built right in. You can share documents with your team, work on them together in real time, and use AI to draft or edit as you go. Whether you're brainstorming, editing, or finalizing a doc, everyone can jump in and contribute seamlessly.
  - question: Do I need to download anything to use Spell?
    answer: Nope! Spell works right in your browser — just like Google Docs. There's nothing to install, no files to download or manage, and no setup required. Everything is cloud-based and saves automatically, so you can just open a doc, start writing, share your doc, and collaborate with others in real time.
  - question: Can I export the document I create with Spell?
    answer: Yes! You can export your documents from Spell in a variety of formats — including Word, PDF, and Markdown — so you can use them however and wherever you need.
